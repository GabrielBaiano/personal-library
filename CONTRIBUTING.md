# Contributing to My Personal Library

Hi there! 👋

First of all, thank you for your interest in this repository. This is a **personal library** project, meaning it reflects my own reading journey, opinions, and organization methods. However, I am very open to interactions and contributions from the community!

Here is how you can contribute:

## 📚 Book Recommendations

If you know a book you think I would love (or even hate, but should read anyway), let me know!
- Open an **Issue** with the tag `recommendation`.
- Tell me the Title, Author, and why you think it's worth reading.
- No spoilers, please!

## � Better Versions & Translations

Have a better version of a book file (e.g., a cleaner ePub, a higher quality PDF)? Or maybe you have the book in another language (English, French, etc.) that I haven't added yet?
- Feel free to **Open a PR** adding the file to the respective book's folder.
- Please detail what is better or different about this version in the PR description.
- Help me make this library more accessible!

## �🐛 Typos and Fixes

English is not my first language, and typos happen.
- If you find a spelling mistake, a broken link, or a formatting error in the `README.md` or any other file, feel free to open a **Pull Request**.
- Small fixes are always appreciated!

## 🗣️ Discussions

Want to discuss a review? Have a different perspective on *Dune*?
- Feel free to use the **Discussions** tab or comment on the specific Commit/PR.
- Please be respectful. We can disagree about books, but we should always be kind to each other.

## ⚠️ A Note on Reviews

The reviews and ratings in this repository are my personal opinions.
- Please **do not** open PRs to change the content of a review (e.g., changing a rating from 3 to 5 stars because you liked the book).
- If you disagree with a review, let's talk about it in the comments/issues instead!

Happy reading! 📖

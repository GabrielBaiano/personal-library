# Contributing to My Personal Library

Hi there! 👋

First of all, thank you for your interest in this repository. This is a **personal library** project, meaning it reflects my own reading journey, opinions, and organization methods. However, I am very open to interactions and contributions from the community!

Here is how you can contribute:

## 📚 Book Recommendations

If you know a book you think I would love (or even hate, but should read anyway), let me know!
- Open an **Issue** with the tag `recommendation`.
- Tell me the Title, Author, and why you think it's worth reading.
- Tell me the Title, Author, and why you think it's worth reading.
- No spoilers, please!

## 🌍 Translating the Library

Since I often read books in Portuguese (my native language), I might not have the English (or French, Spanish, etc.) version of a **Public Domain** book available.
- If you have a legitimate, copyright-free version of a classic in another language that I've already read/reviewed, **please contribute!**
- This helps make the library accessible to more people around the world.

## 📂 Files & Copyright (Strict Rules)

I **do not** accept copyrighted material in this repository.
- **Do NOT** open PRs attaching book files unless the book is explicitly **Public Domain** (e.g., classics like Tolstoy, Machado de Assis, Austen).

### 🌐 Trusted Sites to Check Copyright
Not sure if a book is Public Domain? Check these trusted sources:
- **[Domínio Público (Brasil)](http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br)**
- **[Project Gutenberg (International)](https://www.gutenberg.org)**
- **[Internet Archive](https://archive.org)**
- **[Wikisource](https://wikisource.org)**

- If you are submitting a Public Domain book:
    - You **must explain** in the PR/Issue description **why** it is copyright-free.
    - Accepted formats: `.pdf`, `.epub`, `.mobi`, `.docx`, `.doc`.
    - **No passwords**: Files must be accessible without passwords.
    - **No bizarre formats**: Stick to the standards listed above.

### "I have a link for a book!"
If you found an *official* or *legal* source for a book (e.g., Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, or an Open Access publication) but don't know how to use Git:
- Open an **Issue** with the tag `book-link`.
- Paste the **Direct Link** to the official source.
- **Avoid links to**: Google Drive, Mega, MediaFire, or any file-sharing service that requires passwords or hosts pirated content. These will be ignored.

## 🐛 Typos and Fixes

English is not my first language, and typos happen.
- If you find a spelling mistake, a broken link, or a formatting error in the `README.md` or any other file, feel free to open a **Pull Request**.
- Small fixes are always appreciated!

## 🗣️ Discussions

Want to discuss a review? Have a different perspective on *Dune*?
- Feel free to use the **Discussions** tab or comment on the specific Commit/PR.
- Please be respectful. We can disagree about books, but we should always be kind to each other.

## ⚠️ A Note on Reviews

The reviews and ratings in this repository are my personal opinions.
- Please **do not** open PRs to change the content of a review (e.g., changing a rating from 3 to 5 stars because you liked the book).
- If you disagree with a review, let's talk about it in the comments/issues instead!

Happy reading! 📖

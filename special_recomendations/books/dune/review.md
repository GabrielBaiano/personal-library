## Review

Dune is a masterpiece of science fiction. The depth of world-building is unparalleled, creating a universe that feels ancient and lived-in. Frank Herbert's exploration of politics, religion, and ecology is as relevant today as it was when the book was written.

The story follows Paul Atreides as his family navigates the treacherous politics of the Padishah Empire. Arrakis, the desert planet, is a character in itself—harsh, unforgiving, yet beautiful.

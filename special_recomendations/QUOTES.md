# 📜 Infinite Wisdom (Quotes)

A collection of lines that stuck with me.

## Dune - Frank Herbert

> "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

> "The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience."

> "Um homem deve escolher bem suas batalhas… e suas músicas."
> <br>— **Gurney Halleck** - PT-BR

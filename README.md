    This is my personal library.
    Here, I share the books I’m currently reading, along with my thoughts, reflections, and notes on each one.
    I also make the books I read available here, so you can download them for free, read at your own pace, and form your own conclusions — a topic I’ll discuss further below regarding piracy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Disclaimer:</b> As I’m Brazilian, Portuguese is my primary language, which means most of the books I read are in Portuguese. However, I also read many books in English.
    For this reason, I’ll always try to make an English version of each book available, regardless of the language I read it in, so more people can enjoy it.

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
    This project was born as a way to organize my readings, build a consistent reading routine, and create a kind of personal book club — a quiet space where I read regularly, reflect on what I’ve read, discuss ideas, and give each book a final evaluation.
</p>
<p>
    I’ve tried other reading-tracking platforms like Goodreads and Skoob, but they never quite fit my rhythm. Over time, they felt less practical and eventually faded away. I’ve always been drawn to personal blogs — small, intentional corners of the internet where thoughts can exist without pressure, algorithms, or advertising.
</p>
<p>
    This library is my attempt to combine structure and freedom: a place to keep track of what I read, to write things down, and to turn reading into a habit rather than a task. It’s likely that only a few people will ever wander through here — perhaps a couple of friends I share a book or a review with — but that’s more than enough. This space exists first and foremost for reflection, for continuity, and for the quiet joy of reading itself.
</p>

<a id="structure"></a>
<h3>1.1 📂 Structure</h3>
<p>
    The repository is organized logically to separate readings by period and category:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Year Folders (e.g., 2026):</b> Contains the books read during that specific year.</li>
        <li><b>Special Recommendations:</b> A curated collection of my all-time favorites and must-reads.</li>
    </ul>
    Inside each main directory, you will find a <code>books</code> folder where each title gets its own space, containing the review file and book cover.
</p>

<br>

<h2>2. What i'm reading ?</h2>

   This section is a table with the books i'm currently reading.

<h2>3. The finished books</h2>
<p>
    This section contains a table of the most recent books I’ve finished.
    Whenever I complete a book, I add it here. As the list grows, older entries are moved to a more complete archive of finished books by respective year folder.
</p>
<a id="finished"></a>
<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" align="center">Finished books</th>

<h2>4. My special recommendations</h2>
<p>
    Here are the books that I believe are absolute must-reads — the ones that stayed with me long after I finished the last page.
    <br>
    Here, you’ll find more intimate and in-depth reviews, shaped by reflection and, in some cases, multiple rereads. Not every book listed here will resonate with you in the same way it did with me. Some of them live close to my heart because they arrived at the right moment, at the right time in my life — they made perfect sense to me then, even if they might not to you now.

        Dune is an absolute masterpiece of science fiction. The world-building is incredibly deep, mixing politics, religion, and ecology in a way that feels unmatched. Arrakis feels like a real, breathing place.
        <br><br>
        It's a dense read but rewarding. The journey of Paul Atreides is epic in scale.

<h2>5. Except... is it piracy?</h2>
<p>
    This is a delicate topic, but one that needs to be addressed.
    I believe that knowledge and culture should be accessible to everyone. In an ideal world, we would all have the means to support the authors, artists, and creators we love.
</p>
<p>
    However, the reality—especially in countries like Brazil—is that books can be prohibitively expensive compared to the average income.
    My stance is simple: <b>financial barriers should never stop you from reading.</b>
</p>
<p>
    If you have the financial means, <b>please buy the book</b>. Support the author, the publisher, and the ecosystem that makes these stories possible.
    But if you cannot afford it right now, don't let that stop you. Read the digital version, borrow it, share it. The most important thing is that the knowledge is transferred, that the story is heard, and that you keep reading.
</p>
<p>
    Someday, when you can, you will buy that special edition to put on your shelf. Until then, read.
</p>

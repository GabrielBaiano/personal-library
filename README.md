    This is my personal library.
    Here, I share the books I’m currently reading, along with my thoughts, reflections, and notes on each one.
    I also make the books I read available here, so you can download them for free, read at your own pace, and form your own conclusions — a topic I’ll discuss further below regarding piracy.
    <br>
    <b>Disclaimer:</b> As I’m Brazilian, Portuguese is my primary language, which means most of the books I read are in Portuguese. However, I also read many books in English.
    For this reason, I’ll always try to make an English version of each book available, regardless of the language I read it in, so more people can enjoy it.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Welcome to my personal library! Reading is a journey, and this repository serves as my travel log. 
  Here, I document not just the books I finish, but the process of reading them—the ideas they spark, the quotes that resonate, 
  and the honest reviews of my experience. Whether it's science fiction, history, or philosophy, you'll find it all cataloged here.

        <em>"A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct."</em>
        <br><br>
        Dune is an absolute masterpiece of science fiction. The world-building is incredibly deep, mixing politics, religion, and ecology in a way that feels unmatched. Arrakis feels like a real, breathing place.
        <br><br>
        It's a dense read but rewarding. The journey of Paul Atreides is epic in scale.

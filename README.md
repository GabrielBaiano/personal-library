    This is my personal library.
    Here, I share the books I’m currently reading, along with my thoughts, reflections, and notes on each one.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>About this repository:</b> I do make book files available here, but <b>only</b> if they are free of copyright (Public Domain). This repository is dedicated solely to my reading journey.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Language Note:</b> I read in various languages (Portuguese, French, English), so my reviews—**which are always in English**—reflect the specific nuances of the edition I read. For Public Domain books, I share the text I read, but I will also aim to include an English version for broader accessibility. Missing a translation?

<a id="introduction"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
    This project was born as a way to organize my readings, build a consistent reading routine, and create a kind of personal book club — a quiet space where I read regularly, reflect on what I’ve read, discuss ideas, and give each book a final evaluation.
</p>
<p>
    I’ve tried other reading-tracking platforms like Goodreads and Skoob, but they never quite fit my rhythm. Over time, they felt less practical and eventually faded away. I’ve always been drawn to personal blogs — small, intentional corners of the internet where thoughts can exist without pressure, algorithms, or advertising.
</p>
<p>
    This library is my attempt to combine structure and freedom: a place to keep track of what I read, to write things down, and to turn reading into a habit rather than a task. It’s likely that only a few people will ever wander through here — perhaps a couple of friends I share a book or a review with — but that’s more than enough. This space exists first and foremost for reflection, for continuity, and for the quiet joy of reading itself.
</p>

<a id="structure"></a>
<h3>1.1 📂 Structure</h3>
<p>
    The repository is organized logically to separate readings by period and category:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Year Folders (e.g., 2026):</b> Contains the books read during that specific year.</li>
        <li><b>Special Recommendations:</b> A curated collection of my all-time favorites and must-reads.</li>
    </ul>
    Inside each main directory, you will find a <code>books</code> folder where each title gets its own space, containing the review file, book cover and the book.
</p>

<br>

<h2>4. My special recommendations</h2>
<p>
    Here are the books that I believe are absolute must-reads — the ones that stayed with me long after I finished the last page.
    <br><br>
    Here, you’ll find more intimate and in-depth reviews, shaped by reflection and, in some cases, multiple rereads. Not every book listed here will resonate with you in the same way it did with me. Some of them live close to my heart because they arrived at the right moment, at the right time in my life — they made perfect sense to me then, even if they might not to you now.

        Dune is an absolute masterpiece of science fiction. The world-building is incredibly deep, mixing politics, religion, and ecology in a way that feels unmatched. Arrakis feels like a real, breathing place.
        <br><br>
        It's a dense read but rewarding. The journey of Paul Atreides is epic in scale.

<h3>4.1 📜 Sentences That Never Left</h3>
<p>
   Some sentences don’t stay on the page.
<br>
<br>
They follow us long after the book is closed, resurfacing at unexpected moments — in silence, in doubt, in clarity. A single line can carry more weight than an entire chapter. Sometimes it arrives at the exact moment we need it. Other times, we only understand its meaning years later.
<br>
<br>
Certain phrases mark us not because they are universally profound, but because they meet us where we are. They resonate with something unspoken, name a feeling we didn’t know how to articulate, or quietly shift the way we see ourselves or the world.
<br>
<br>
These words become companions. We return to them, underline them, rewrite them in notebooks, carry them with us. They remind us of who we were when we first read them — and how far we’ve come since.
<br>
<br>
This section exists to hold those fragments. Not as definitive truths, but as moments of recognition. Words that stayed. Words that shaped me.

<a id="piracy"></a>
<h2>5. Except... is it piracy?</h2>

<p>
    Reading should be a simple act: a book, a reader, and time. Yet, in many parts of the world, reading is shaped not only by curiosity or desire, but by access, money, and circumstance.
</p>
<p>
    This chapter exists to talk honestly about that tension — between loving books and being able to afford them, between supporting creators and wanting knowledge to circulate freely. There are no easy answers here, only context, lived experience, and questions worth asking.
</p>

<a id="odds"></a>
<h3>5.1 Reading Against the Odds: A Brazilian Perspective</h3>
<p>
    Brazil is not the center of the global discussion on reading access, but it is where my experience begins — and it reflects many of the challenges faced elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
    Books in Brazil are often prohibitively expensive compared to the average income. Reading is treated less as a basic cultural practice and more as a luxury, a collectible, or even a form of elitism. Recent data illustrates this clearly: around 53% of Brazilians did not read a single book in 2024, while only 47% are considered readers, defined as people who read at least part of one book in the last three months. The average number of books read per person per year is just under four, and over the last four years, Brazil has lost roughly 6.7 million readers.
</p>
<p>
    The Bible remains the most widely read book in the country, highlighting how concentrated the reading public is. Even within this small group, economic barriers remain a constant challenge. Access increasingly depends on large digital platforms — online retailers like Amazon, or digital services such as Kindle and Google Play Books.
</p>
<p>
    Physical books present additional obstacles. Many editions prioritize aesthetics over accessibility: hardcover releases, premium paper, special artwork, or collector’s editions — all of which significantly increase prices. Scarcity adds to the problem: niche books often have small print runs, and as supply diminishes, prices rise rapidly. Some titles never reach Brazil at all, or are not translated, further restricting access.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine buying a book and not liking it, or losing the motivation to finish it, or discovering it wasn’t what you expected — suddenly the financial investment itself becomes a burden. A personal example illustrates the scale: in 2020, I bought my first copy of Dune along with the Sprawl trilogy by William Gibson (Neuromancer and its sequels*) for R$125.12. At the time, Dune alone cost R$48, in a year when the Brazilian minimum wage was R$1,039.00 — three books represented roughly 12% of a monthly minimum wage. Even as the minimum wage has increased since then, the prices of books have risen even faster, often outpacing income growth. Following the release of films and TV adaptations, prices for some titles surged, and today, physical copies of Dune often approach or exceed R$100.
</p>
<p>
    The situation is even more severe when it comes to educational books. Textbooks for higher education, especially in fields like medicine, can be prohibitively expensive. A single semester’s set of books may exceed 60% of the minimum wage, making access to essential educational materials a major barrier — and a destructive one for students who already face economic pressure.
</p>
<p>
    This is the reality I faced — and it is the lens through which I approach this discussion. While this subchapter focuses on Brazil, these barriers exist in many parts of the world, shaped by economic, social, cultural, or even religious factors. Different contexts, similar outcomes: access to literature is often limited, and reading is not always freely available to those who wish to engage with it.
</p>

<a id="access"></a>
<h3>5.2 From Access to Piracy</h3>
<p>
    The Brazilian context is not an argument, but a starting point. It illustrates the tension between desire, access, and affordability — a tension that exists worldwide and often leads to a difficult question: when access is blocked by circumstance, what are the ethical ways to satisfy the need to read?
</p>
<p>
    If you have the financial means, buy the book. Support the author, the publisher, and the ecosystem that makes these stories possible. But if you cannot afford it right now, don’t let that stop you. Borrow it. Read a digital copy. Share knowledge. Stories need readers as much as they need shelves.
</p>
<p>
    Someday, when you can, you’ll buy that special edition and place it proudly on your shelf.
    <br>
    Until then — read.
</p>
